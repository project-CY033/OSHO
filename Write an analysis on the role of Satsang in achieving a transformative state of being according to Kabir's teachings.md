According to Kabir's teachings, as presented in the document 'OSHO: Kabir - Buddha Aur Meera Ka Sangam', Satsang plays a crucial role in achieving a transformative state of being. Satsang, which can be understood as "living with truth," is not merely a gathering or a ritualistic practice but a profound spiritual experience that facilitates transformation.

1. **Nature of Satsang**: Kabir's concept of Satsang is distinct from traditional rational pilgrimages. It is described as a pilgrimage of a different kind, one that is not based on reason but on a deeper, experiential engagement with truth. This engagement involves sitting near the master, participating in singing, dancing, and sometimes embracing silence or speech, allowing oneself to be immersed in the experience.

2. **Transformative Experience**: The transformative power of Satsang lies in its ability to fill the seeker with spiritual essence. Kabir likens the master to a rain-filled cloud of the monsoon, suggesting that those who come to Satsang empty, like a cup, will be filled with spiritual nourishment. This metaphor highlights the transformative potential of Satsang, where the seeker, like a peacock dancing in the rain, becomes receptive to the spiritual downpour.

3. **State of 'Khumaari'**: A key aspect of the transformative state achieved through Satsang is 'Khumaari', a state that transcends ordinary consciousness and unconsciousness. It is described as a miraculous state where one is both intoxicated and awake, a state of being that is neither fully conscious nor unconscious but a blend of both. This state is achieved through the deep engagement with the spiritual essence, or 'Ramras', during Satsang.

4. **Beyond Rational Understanding**: Kabir's approach through Satsang is contrasted with the rational explanations of other spiritual traditions. While figures like Mahavir use reason and argument, Kabir's method is more akin to a gathering of spiritual intoxication, where the focus is on drinking the essence of Ram, not in a literal sense, but as a metaphor for absorbing spiritual truth.

In summary, Satsang, according to Kabir, is a transformative practice that goes beyond rational understanding and engages the seeker in a deep, experiential process. It facilitates a state of 'Khumaari', where the boundaries of consciousness and unconsciousness blur, leading to a profound spiritual awakening. This transformative state is achieved through the immersive and participatory nature of Satsang, where the seeker becomes receptive to the spiritual essence imparted by the master.
