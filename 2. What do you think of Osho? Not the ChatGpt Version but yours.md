# 2. What do you think of Osho? Not the ChatGpt Version but yours


### I think he was a great seer. He explains things in depth and lucidity. As talking about sex is taboo in our society people have restrained from watching him
### He was ahead of his time. Unlike other wannabe holy men,he embraced having luxury and sex in life. Everybody hates someone for no reason. When an organization or cult gets bigger the top guy would be having less commanding power. His associates messed up really bad.
### He was an academic philosopher and a great orator. His talks and books are worthwhile. I guess the money and fame went into his head at the end of his life. He said many bold things that were wild for that age that brought the ire of traditionalists, governments. In the current age, he had to be just a popular youtube figure.
### Osho also known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, was a controversial spiritual teacher and philosopher
###  His ideas about meditation, love, and living in the present moment have inspired millions worldwide
###  Osho developed dynamic meditation techniques aimed at releasing suppressed emotions and achieving self-awareness
### Osho's discourses on consciousness, mindfulness, and self-awareness can be included in datasets used to train LLMs
### AI tools and technologies are used by Osho International and related organizations to digitize and distribute his books, audio, and video content
### Osho's focus on the balance between technology and human values might offer insights into creating AI systems
### Osho questions that is there any human whose mind is not filled with complaints Whether at home,office, god, relationship  we always do complaining we always look at what we did not get

### OSGO says that humans tend to live either in their past or is in the future worries. He remains unhappy in both of these situations
### we always run away from our sorrows and responsibilities and always find excuses to escape from them. We always blame others for our mistakes and failures. We can never be happy by going away from reality
### Osho has explained that the reason for the misery of human is that he does not accept anything or person as much as it is
### Osho says that human beings are always in tension the possibility of wandering and aggressive in it always remains hidden he is not happy and happy

### Applying Osho’s principles to AI ethics could encourage a future where technology not only enhances human lives but also contributes to a deeper understanding of existence
